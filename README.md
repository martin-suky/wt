# World of Taxonomy
Aim of this project is to create open encyclopedie for identification of animals. And to test some technologies I am not completely familiar with.

## Technologies
Server
* Spring Boot

Client
* Typescript
* React
* Flux

## Start DEV mode
First version. Hopefully I will improve it in future.

* Run server
  * `mvn spring-boot:run`
* Run watchify
  * `cd src/main/resources/public`
  * `npm start`
* Use Atom to compile typescript.
